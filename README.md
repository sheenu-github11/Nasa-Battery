## 📊 Project Overview

The NASA Battery Dataset provides time series data of battery impedance, resistance, voltage, and other features, collected under different operational conditions. The goal of this project is to:

- Explore the dataset and clean the data for analysis  
- Analyze battery degradation over cycles  
- Visualize trends in internal resistance and impedance  
- Provide interactive plots using Plotly for enhanced insights

## 🧪 Dataset Description

The dataset can be found here on Kaggle:  
🔗 [NASA Battery Dataset on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/patrickfleith/nasa-battery-dataset)

It includes data from four lithium-ion batteries (B0005, B0006, B0007, and B0018) tested under different load conditions until failure. The measurements were taken during charging, discharging, and impedance phases.

**Key features include:**

- Voltage  
- Current  
- Temperature  
- Internal Resistance (Rₑ)  
- Charge Transfer Resistance (Rct)  
- Cycles

## 📌 Key Insights

- **Battery Degradation**: Clear evidence of rising internal resistance and impedance over time  
- **Cycle Impact**: Batteries show degradation patterns unique to their test conditions  
- **Visualizations**: Plots show Rₑ and Rct increasing as cycle count increases
